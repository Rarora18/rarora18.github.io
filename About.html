<p>Hi, I’m Raghav Arora – part-time coding ninja, full-time coffee enthusiast. By day, I’m a computer science student trying to make sense of data structures (yes, AVL trees, I’m looking at you 👀), and by night, I’m dreaming of conquering the fintech world with my future groundbreaking app (name TBD, but it’ll definitely have a sleek logo).

    I’m the type of person who quotes “Be the toolsmith, not the miner” in conversations because, let’s face it, being the unsung hero is kind of my thing. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me investing in stocks, overanalyzing Marina Oshan’s arguments, or attempting to make AI sound cool to non-tech friends. Spoiler: It usually involves saying, “It’s like Iron Man’s Jarvis but smarter.”
    
    Quirks include: getting sidetracked by YouTube rabbit holes on heap data structures, blaming my compiler for all my bugs (thanks, Apple Clang), and keeping the dream alive that one day I’ll explain complex logic without sounding like a malfunctioning chatbot.
    
    If you’re into growth mindsets, fintech, or existential debates over coffee, we’re probably already friends – you just don’t know it yet.</p>
